# Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands has been a key player in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. However, due to strategic missteps and ineffective decision-making, the company has been losing market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotel segments. To address this challenge, the managing director proposed the integration of Business and Data Intelligence to reclaim their market position. Lacking an in-house data analytics team, AtliQ Grands decided to hire a third-party service provider to generate insights from their historical data and guide their strategic decisions.
